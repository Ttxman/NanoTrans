## Transcription format
format is defined in TRSXSchema3.xsd  
in general all tags can have any number of custom attributes, NanoTrans will not delete or modify them. (but if tag is deleted or merged custom attributes are lost)  
For custom structured data there is \<meta\> tag. You can store anything in it and it will be preserved.  

## Import and export plugins
plugins are defined in Plugins.xml  
there are 2 possible ways to create plugin:  
### exe/script
commmand is executed by shell with parameters {0} and {1}, where {0} is input file and {1} is output file  
exact parameter string for executable is specified in Plugins.xml  
### .NET assembly
assembly and class are specified in Plugins.xml  
On the specified class public static method is called to do the importin/exporting  
required formats are:  
import: Func\<Stream, Transcription, bool\> ... public static bool Import(Stream input, Transcription storage)  
export: Func\<Transcription, Stream, bool\> ... public static bool Export(Transcription t, Stream Output)  

## Localization
To add localization you have to add resource file called "Strings.LOCALE.resx" to the project "NanoTrans" in Properties section. It should contains same lines as "Strings.resx".  
Only requirement to LOCALE is to be usable in constuctor new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(Locale);  
Localization selection is automatic based on culture set in Windows. You can override this in settings.  
Additional editing of source shouldn't be necessary.
